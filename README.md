This is a JavaFX/SQL program.

This was a school project for a course that required an appointment scheduling application. 

It allows users to add, delete and edit appointment information. It has a function to translate the login screen into multiple languages depending on the region.

It was connected to a MySQL database stored on a server run by the school, but the DB has been disconnected. 

Thanks for checking out my code!
